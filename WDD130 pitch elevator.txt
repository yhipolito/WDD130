Have you tried to make a website before? I know this might be new for you and maybe could be an unexplored field. Let me tell you that I am enrolled to a course that is teaching me that basics of how to create websites by applying HTML, CSS, and JavaScript concepts. Don't be afraid if you donâ€™t know what I am talking about, but trust me, you have already been in contact with these by interacting with different websites. We can do the same, isn't great? Do you want to see what I am able to create?
