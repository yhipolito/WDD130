                <h2>Frequently asked questions</h2>
                <h4>Do you redesign existing websites?</h4>
                <p>We certainly can do! It is important to approach website redesigns sensitively to make sure your
                    reasons for redesigning are valid. This will ensure the project is an overall success from your ROI
                    point of view.</p>
                <h4>Do you work internationally?</h4>
                <p>Of course! With the advent of online conference tools such as Zoom, appear.in, and of course Skype,
                    just to name a few, it makes working with businesses anywhere in the world straight forward enough.</p>    
                <h4>Do you offer ongoing help with our new site once it's launched?</h4>
                <p>If you need our help with web support and maintenance, we will be here for you. If not, we will leave
                    you to it. If you change your mind and need us after all, we will still be here for you!</p>    
                <h4>Will my website work on smart phones and tablets as well?</h4>
                <p>It most certainly will! More people are accessing the web via small screens than ever, and the trend
                    is likely to carry on. If your site does not display or work properly on a mobile or tablet screen,
                    you risk losing a big chunk of your potential audience. It means mobile responsive web design is
                    essential these days. Every website we create is mobile responsive.</p>
