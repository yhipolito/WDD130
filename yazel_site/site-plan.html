        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <h3>Purpose</h3>
        <p>Have you tried to make a website before? I know this might be new for you and maybe could be an unexplored
            field. Let me tell you that I am enrolled to a course that is teaching me that basics of how to create
            websites by applying HTML, CSS, and JavaScript concepts. Don't be afraid if you donâ€™t know what I am talking
            about, but trust me, you have already been in contact with these by interacting with different websites. We
            can do the same, isn't great? Do you want to see what I am able to create?
        </p> <!-- change this -->


        <h3>Audience</h3>
        <p>My intended audience is my family, friends and colleagues. Why I choose my family? well, I choose them
            because they are the most special people for who I am studing computer programming now. I would love to show
            them what I am learning on my classes. I also would like to share what I am learning with my friends and
            colleagues of work. I have a special schedule of work. So, I have plenty of time to show my colleagues what
            I am working on.</p> <!-- change this -->

        <h3>Home page</h3>
        <p>
            * Why will people come to your site?<br><br>

            To see what I can create on websites, How I can structure a site. How I can combine the colors and how I use
            different font styles and sizes. After they have seen what I am able to do, they will have the chance to
            create their own website or interested to enroll a computer programming course. This experience will be
            great for all of them who were thinking to take the advantages of a website applied to their business or
            ideas. They will also come because their curiosity about websites. So, I will try to make that site simple
            and logic to see and pass the time.
        </p>
        <p>
            * What questions will your visitors expect your site to answer for them?<br><br>

            I think the first question anyone could ask him or herself is How a website is created? another question
            they might have could be What am I able to put in a website? another question will be; Am I able to create
            websites? How can I use website for my business or projects? I think that it might be another kind of
            questions in mind, and that is why I will include frequent asked questions FAQs on my website. So, they will
            have the opportunity to answer their personal questions by themselves.
        </p>
        <p>
            * What types of activities will visitors want to complete on your site?<br><br>

            They will have the opportunity to explore the whole website; they will observe the structure of the website
            with their different colors and font sizes and font styles. They will interact between pages of the site.
            They must not wait too long to load the site on their devices. And finally, they will have the opportunity
            to read the FAQ that will ask their own questions.
        </p>
        <p>
            * What information is necessary to complete any actions your site offers?<br><br>

            -Follow my wireframe design I have previously elaborated for my personal website
            -Select the best pictures for my website.
            -Check for the image optimization process using pages like resize.com or tiny.com
            -include FAQ about the creation and use of websites.
            -Structure my website with grid or flexbox.
            -Follow or adjust my colors pallete.
            -Follow the font style selected or replace it if it is needed.
            -Link the home page to the additional pages that will be in my website.
            -check that my website will not take too long to be opened.
            -check for responsiveness on many devices like laptop, desktop, smartphone, and tablet.
        </p>
        <p>
            * Why will your visitors come to your site instead of another to get this information or complete the
            actions?<br><br>

            It will be hard for them just go to any website to learn. They will not have the motivation to learn from
            websites until I will show to them the possibilities of creating websites. For that reason, I will invite
            them to come to my website to look at it, after that they will have the curiosity to go to any website to
            see how those websites are elaborated.
            My friends will come at first because our friendship relation. My family will come because our family
            relationship. They might go to any website, but they will not find what I am able to do or show to them. I
            believe that their experience will be an introduction and demonstration of the possibilities of the creation
            of a website.

        <h3>Faq</h3>
        <p>
            Do you redesign existing websites?<br><br>

            We certainly can do! Itâ€™s important to approach website redesigns sensitively to make sure your reasons for
            redesigning are valid. This will ensure the project is an overall success from your ROI point of
            view.<br><br>

            Do you work internationally?<br><br>

            Of course! With the advent of online conference tools such as Zoom, appear.in, and of course Skype, just to
            name a few, it makes working with businesses anywhere in the world straight forward enough.<br><br>

            Do you offer ongoing help with our new site once it's launched?<br><br>

            If you need our help with web support and maintenance, weâ€™ll be here for you. If not, we will leave you to
            it. If you change your mind and need us after all, weâ€™ll still be here for you!<br><br>

            Will my website work on smart phones and tablets as well?<br><br>

            It most certainly will! More people are accessing the web via small screens than ever, and the trend is
            likely to carry on. If your site doesnâ€™t display or work properly on a mobile or tablet screen, you risk
            losing a big chunk of your potential audience. It means mobile responsive web design is essential these
            days. Every website we create is mobile responsive.
